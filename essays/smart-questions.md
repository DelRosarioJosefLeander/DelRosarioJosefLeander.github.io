## Whatâ€™s a makes a smart question?

Eric Raymond, a prominent figure in the open-source software movement and author of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," has a well-known perspective on what constitutes a "smart question." In his essay "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way," he outlines key principles for asking questions effectively, especially in technical or open-source communities.

According to Raymond, a smart question is characterized by the following qualities:

1. **Research Before Asking:** The asker should have made a genuine effort to solve the problem on their own before seeking help. This means doing some preliminary research, such as checking documentation, searching online, and trying to troubleshoot the issue independently.

2. **Clear and Specific:** The question should be well-defined and specific. It should include relevant details about what the problem is, what has been tried so far, and why those attempts have not worked.

3. **Provide Context:** Include any relevant background information that could help others understand the problem better. This might involve providing code snippets, error messages, or describing the environment in which the issue occurs.

4. **Be Polite and Considerate:** Frame the question politely and respectfully. Acknowledge that the people you are asking for help are offering their time and expertise.

5. **Be Open to Learning:** Demonstrate a willingness to learn from the responses. This means being open to suggestions, being ready to test proposed solutions, and following up on advice given.

By adhering to these principles, the questioner increases the likelihood of receiving a helpful and timely response while also showing respect for the expertise of others.
