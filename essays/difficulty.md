*Typescript: A Learning Experience*

  In order to learn TypeScript, one must first understand JavaScript, as TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that allows developers to add data types to their variables. Initially, I found the exclusion of data types in JavaScript to be very jarring, as the other programming languages I’ve studied use data types. TypeScript has proven to be useful in many ways when writing JavaScript code, especially when dealing with functions.
  Learning something new always requires a good amount of effort, this includes the topic of this paper: TypeScript. As mentioned before, I found studying JavaScript quite jarring because of its difference from the other programming languages I’ve studied. I feel as if my understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript has only scratched the surface. However, I’m eager to dive deeper and continue building my skills in both languages.
