*Typescript: A Learning Experience*

  In order to learn TypeScript, one must first understand JavaScript, as TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that allows developers to add data types to their variables. Initially, I found the exclusion of data types in JavaScript to be very jarring, as the other programming languages I’ve studied use data types. TypeScript has proven to be useful in many ways when writing JavaScript code, especially when dealing with functions and improving program readability. I feel that if I were to work on larger projects in JavaScript, I would spend more time trying to read the code because it feels less organized than what I am used to.
  
  Learning something new always requires a good amount of effort, and this includes the topic of this paper: TypeScript. As mentioned before, I found studying JavaScript quite jarring because of its differences from the other programming languages I’ve studied, especially when dealing with data types. I feel as if my understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript has only scratched the surface. However, I’m eager to dive deeper and continue building my skills in both languages. With time and practice, I hope to become proficient in both programming languages.
